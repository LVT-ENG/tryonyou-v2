# Folder Overview

This document maps the folders used in the repository and clarifies which ones are essential for deployment.

## Key Folders
- `public/` – Production build generated by `npm run build`.
- `scripts/` – Helper scripts for SEO metadata, Shopify sync, and automation flows.
- `docs/` – Deployment, automation and agent guides. `deployment_overview.md` links the most relevant files.
- `agents/` – JavaScript agents used by the demo and automation scripts.
- `automa_flows/` and `scenarios/` – JSON templates for browser Automa flows and Make scenarios.

## Legacy / Demo
- `frontend/` – Static demo version of the app (legacy). The root `index.html` is the main entry point today.
- Other HTML files like `tryonme_landing.html` are kept only for reference.

Start with `docs/deployment_overview.md` for the latest deployment steps.
