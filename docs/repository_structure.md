# Repository Structure Overview

This document summarizes the purpose of the main directories so it is easier to locate the latest files before deployment.

- `index.html` – Main landing page with updated SEO tags. The build process outputs a copy into `public/`.
- `public/` – Contains the production build generated by Vite. Files inside are overwritten on each build.
- `frontend/` – Legacy demo kept for reference. No longer used in the deploy script.
- `agents/` – JavaScript agents including `brandGuardian` and `deployScriptMaster`.
- `scripts/` – Utility scripts for deployment, Shopify sync, SEO validation and site monitoring. Key helpers include `seo_audit.py`, `site_health_check.py` for email alerts, and `auto_update.py` to pull new datasets.
- `docs/` – Documentation of deployment steps, automation flows and project guides. Start with `docs/README.md` and `docs/deployment_consolidated.md` for the most up‑to‑date instructions.
- `03_Agentes_Inteligentes/` and `04_Scripts_Produccion/` – Older shell scripts, now moved to `archive/` since their tasks are handled by `deploy/` and `scripts/`.

When reviewing duplicate files, prefer those in the root and `scripts/` directories, as they are referenced by the deployment guides.
