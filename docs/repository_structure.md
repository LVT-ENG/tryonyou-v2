# Repository Structure Overview

This document summarizes the purpose of the main directories so it is easier to locate the latest files before deployment.

- `index.html` – Main landing page with updated SEO tags. The build process outputs a copy into `public/`.
- `public/` – Contains the production build generated by Vite. Files inside are overwritten on each build.
- `frontend/` – Legacy demo kept for reference. No longer used in the deploy script.
- `agents/` – JavaScript agents including `brandGuardian` and `deployScriptMaster`.
- `scripts/` – Utility scripts for deployment, Shopify sync, SEO validation and
  site monitoring. `scripts/quick_zip_deploy.sh` provides a one‑line unzip and
  Vercel deploy helper when working with prebuilt ZIP archives.
- `docs/` – Documentation of deployment steps, automation flows and project guides.
- `03_Agentes_Inteligentes/` and `04_Scripts_Produccion/` – Older shell scripts; most functionality is now covered by `deploy/` and `scripts/`.
- `deploy/` – Primary cross‑platform deploy script (`deploy/deploy.sh`).
- `tryonme_server.js` – Obsolete server prototype kept for reference; the
  maintained API entrypoint is `server.js`.

When reviewing duplicate files, prefer those in the root and `scripts/` directories, as they are referenced by the deployment guides.
