**TRY-ON** is a next-gen virtual fitting room powered by emotional AI and real-body avatars. It recommends clothing based on real measurements, aesthetic preferences, and personal emotional context.

## 👤 What it does
- Generates a 3D avatar based on your body (manual or scan)
- Matches you with clothing that *feels right* (not just fits)
- Connects you to brands like LIVER 'IT and others

## 🔍 Features
- Multi-dimensional comparison: fit + emotion + aesthetics
- Open to all brands, with LIVER 'IT as premium showcase
- Data is private, ethical and encrypted

## 🚀 Demo
A working HTML/CSS demo is available in the `frontend/` folder. Activate GitHub Pages to preview.
