# Scripts

Utility scripts for deployment, synchronization and automation.

- `auto_update.py` – fetches remote data and optionally syncs products.
- `sync_to_shopify.py` – pushes products to Shopify.
- `cron_daily.sh` – daily cleanup and sync (add to crontab).

These scripts integrate with external services such as Google Drive and Shopify.
