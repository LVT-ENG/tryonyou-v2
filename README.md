**TRY-ON** is a virtual fitting room powered by emotional AI. Version 2.0 is under development.

## \ud83d\udc64 What it does
- Generates a 3D avatar based on your body (manual or scan)
- Matches you with clothing that *feels right* (not just fits)
- Connects you to brands like LIVER 'IT and others

## \ud83d\dd0d Features
- Multi-dimensional comparison: fit + emotion + aesthetics
- Open to all brands, with LIVER 'IT as premium showcase
- Data is private, ethical and encrypted

## v2.0 Modules (placeholders)
- Multilanguage site for Wix (`estructura.html`, `video_portada.mp4`, `textos_home.txt`)
- Shopify import via `productos.csv` and `precios.txt`
- Make server connection to `/upload`
- 3D avatar matching logic
- AutoDonate integration
- GPT agents: LookCurator, PMV, ContentPro, FactoryMaster
- Backup codes and credential security

> **Note**: These modules are stubs in this repository and require further implementation.
